# UConnRecCapacity
Python program to get capacity for UConn's Rec Center

I created this in Spring 2021 using Python, Selenium, and a couple other things. It's old, and I had neglected to put it on my GitHub.

Capacity.py is used for testing and simply prints the capacity when the program is ran.

CapacityWriter.py, if I remember correctly, is what I used to log the capacity of the Rec Center into a .csv file at 5-minute intervals.
